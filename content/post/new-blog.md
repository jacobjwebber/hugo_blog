## New Blog!

Where better to start a new blog than a blog post about how I made this blog.

Over the last Christmas holidays I have started playing around with the Go programming languages. Wow! What a great
programming language! At work I mainly wrote Java code, and at University I mainly use C. Go seems to combine a lot of
the positive aspects of both. It also has a very interesting and neat model for writing parallel or concurrent programs.
I hope to write a blog about this soon as I have been working on porting some OpenMP code over to Go. 

To show all this off I thought I had better make a personal website. I already had already set up a github pages repo
and just needed some pages to fill it.
