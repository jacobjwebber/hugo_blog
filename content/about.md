## Personal

As well as writing computer programs, I am also a fun guy.

Growing up I had an interest in music, as well as mathematics and physics. I played the violin quite successfully,
playing in a number of youth orchsestras, including as a soloist. I managed to combine these two separate interests
in my undergraduate degree. This was in Physics and Music at the University of Edinburgh.
